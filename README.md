## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to AiBizHub! I'm Charlotte, and I help small business owners cut through the AI hype to find tools that actually work.

As a small business owner myself, I was overwhelmed by the hundreds of AI tools promising to "revolutionize" my business. Most were overhyped, overpriced, or overcomplicated.

So I decided to test them all.

Every week, I spend 20+ hours testing AI tools with real small business scenarios. I measure everything: time saved, money made, ease of use, and actual ROI.

ðŸŽ¯ What you'll find here:
- Honest reviews of AI tools (I buy and test everything myself)
- Step-by-step setup guides for small businesses
- "Free vs Paid" comparisons to save you money
- Real case studies with actual dollar results
- Weekly AI news that matters to small businesses

ðŸ“Š By the numbers:
- 100+ AI tools tested
- $50,000+ spent on testing (so you don't have to)
- 2,400+ hours of hands-on testing
- 10,000+ small businesses helped

My promise: I only recommend tools I would use in my own business. If it doesn't pay for itself in 30 days, I won't recommend it.
